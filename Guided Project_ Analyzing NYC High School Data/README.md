# Guided Project_ Analyzing NYC High School Data
One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. This aim of this project is that investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.

The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it.

The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the data set for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.

## Data Resource
There are some website contain some several related data sets covering demographic information and test scores. Here are the links to all of the data sets we'll be using:

* [SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4)- SAT scores for each high school in New York City
* [School attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statist/7z8d-msnt) - Attendance information for each school in New York City
* [Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3) - Information on class size for each school
* [AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-AP-College-Board-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e) - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
* [Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Classes-Of-2005-2010-School-Le/vh2h-md7a) - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
* [Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Demographics-and-Accountability-Snapshot-20/ihfw-zy9j) - Demographic information for each school
* [School survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8) - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school

All of these data sets are interrelated. We'll need to combine them into a single data set before we can find correlations.
