# Chinook Business Project

In this guided project, we're going to practice using our SQL skills to answer business questions. In each step, we'll give you a task, and you'll need to:

* Write a SQL query to extract the relevant data
* Write a short paragraph, drawing conclusions and explaining the data and/or visualizations.
